## Pages and Detailed Implementation
### 1. Landing Page (pages/index.tsx)
**Artboard Size:** 1920px x 1080px
#### Sections & Features:
1. **Hero Section**:
   - **3D Model Display**: 
     - Use `@react-three/fiber` for rendering the hero 3D object (e.g., a futuristic rotating logo or character).
     - Utilize `@react-three/drei`'s `OrbitControls` for user-controlled rotation with restricted zoom levels.
     - Use HDRI environment maps for realistic reflections.
     - **Animation**: Add idle animations like gentle rotation or floating using `gsap` for smooth easing.
   - **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons**:
     - "Explore My Work": Smooth scroll to the About section using `gsap`.
     - "Shop Now": Direct link to the Shopping page.
   - **Responsiveness**: Adjust 3D model scale for different screen sizes using media queries.
2. **Feature Highlights**:
   - **Feature Cards**:
     - Create cards using TailwindCSS to describe skills and services.
     - Icons from libraries like LucideReact for a clean look.
     - **Hover Animation**: Use `gsap` to animate scaling and shadows.
     - **Scroll Animation**: Use `ScrollTrigger` from `gsap` to fade-in cards as they enter the viewport.
3. **Footer**:
   - **Social Links**: Include icons linking to GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
   - **Back to Top Button**: Smooth scroll to the top using `gsap`.

### 2. About Page (pages/about.tsx)
**Artboard Size:** 1920px x 3000px
#### Sections & Features:
1. **3D Timeline/Carousel**:
   - **Interactive 3D Scene**:
     - Use `@react-three/fiber` to create a 3D timeline where each milestone is represented as a clickable 3D object.
     - Implement horizontal scroll-based navigation using `@react-three/drei`'s `ScrollControls`.
     - **Milestone Details**: Clickable objects trigger a side panel with additional information (e.g., project details).
   - **Camera Transitions**: Use `gsap` to animate smooth transitions between milestones as the user scrolls.

. **Skills & Projects**:
   - **Skills Grid**:
     - Create a responsive grid of cards using TailwindCSS.
     - Each card represents a skill, with hover effects for further details using `gsap`.
     - **3D Representation**: Use `@react-three/drei` to display small 3D models of logos or icons.
   - **Project Gallery**:
     - Include a 3D carousel for showcasing projects using `@react-three/drei`'s `ScrollControls` and `Draco` compression for optimized models.

### 3. Shopping Page (pages/shop.tsx)
**Artboard Size:** 1920px x 4000px
#### Sections & Features:
1. **3D Product Viewer**:
   - **3D Model Display**:
     - Use `@google/model-viewer` for high-quality 3D model rendering with AR mode.
     - **AR Feature**: Enable AR view with custom button styling and messaging for unsupported devices.
     - **Gesture Controls**: Allow zooming, rotating, and panning.
   - **Product Interaction**: Include user-friendly buttons for manipulating views (e.g., zoom reset).
2. **Infinite Product Carousel**:
   - **Auto-Scrolling Carousel**: Create a horizontally scrolling carousel using `gsap`.
   - **Product Cards**:
     - Each card displays product details (image, title, price).
     - Use `@google/model-viewer` to render previews within cards.
     - On hover, enlarge using `gsap` for a spotlight effect.
   - **Scroll Interaction**: Infinite loop effect using `ScrollTrigger` to keep the carousel scrolling.
3. **Product Details Modal**:
   - **Modal Design**: TailwindCSS-based modal for detailed views.
   - **AR Integration**: Use `@google/model-viewer` within the modal to trigger AR mode.
   - **Add to Cart**: Integrate Redux for cart state management.
   - **Checkout Placeholder**: Placeholder form for users to send purchase inquiries.
4. **Shopping Cart**:
   - **Slide-In Cart Sidebar**: Display cart items with an animated sidebar using `gsap`.
   - **Cart Management**: Add, remove, and update quantities with Redux.
   - **Total Price Calculation**: Auto-update price totals with Redux selectors.

### 4. Contact Us Page (pages/contact.tsx)
**Artboard Size:** 1920px x 2000px
#### Sections & Features:
1. **3D Interactive Globe**:
   - **Globe Display**: Use `@react-three/fiber` to render a 3D globe with `@react-three/drei`'s `OrbitControls`.
   - **Marker Animation**: Place animated markers for different locations using `gsap`.
   - **User Interaction**: Enable users to rotate and zoom on the globe to view locations.
2. **Contact Form**:
   - **Form Design**: TailwindCSS form with animated input fields.
   - **Submission Animation**: Trigger a `gsap` particle explosion upon successful submission.
   - **Form Validation**: Implement form validation using React state.
3. **Quick Contact Links**:
   - **Responsive Icons**: Include social media icons with hover effects.
   - **Link Animations**: Use `gsap` for subtle animations when links are hovered.

## Workflow Overview
```
1. Initialize Next.js with TailwindCSS.
2. Set up `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for 3D elements.
3. Design 3D models in Blender, export as GLTF/GLB, and integrate using `@react-three/drei`.
4. Implement state management with Redux:
   - Create slices for cart and UI state.
   - Use `redux-persist` for cart persistence across page reloads.
5. Integrate `@google/model-viewer`:
   - Set up AR capabilities with a fallback for unsupported devices.
   - Customize viewer controls and styles.
6. Develop scroll-based animations with `gsap`:
   - Use `ScrollTrigger` for page transitions and 3D camera movements.
   - Animate hero models and page sections.
7. Optimize for Performance:
   - Use lazy loading for 3D models and images.
   - Implement `Suspense` for model loading.
   - Optimize GLTF models with Draco compression.
8. Deploy to Netlify:
   - Set up GitHub actions for automatic deployments.
   - Configure environment for efficient builds.
```
